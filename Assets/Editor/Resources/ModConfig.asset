  title: Bamboozling Time Keeper
  author: VFlyer, Speakingevil
  description: "\"I needed a few more minutes not just a few more seconds!\"\n\nReimagining
    The Time Keeper, Bamboozling Button, Hexabutton, and modules with complicated
    release times and you get a module for the ones who need a new challenge yet again.
    \n\nHold or tap the correct button at a very specific time and then release the
    button at the correct time to finish a stage. Complete both stages to disarm the
    module.\n\nWith help from\nSpeakingevil: For the assistance with reference code.\nR4Y:
    On how to modify obsecure cutouts in Blender\nAnd various users who came in to
    the TP stream to help test this module.\n\nGood luck. I really mean it this time.\n\nSource
